## 🔬 How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: Users upload clear images of plant leaves
2. **Preprocessing**: Images are resized, normalized, and enhanced
3. **Feature Extraction**: CNN extracts visual features from the image
4. **Classification**: Model predicts disease class with confidence scores
5. **Results Display**: Shows prediction results with treatment recommendations
6. **Report Generation**: Creates detailed PDF reports for download
